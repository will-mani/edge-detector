These images are the detected edges of the resized grayscale images. There is no blurring involved, except for one image (guess which). The naming convention is 'Edges[FACTOR].png', where the resized image is FACTOR times bigger than the original (eagle.png). The Averaging blurring technique (cv2.blur) was applied to the original grayscale image with kernel size (8, 8) before producing Edges15Blur8.png. The detection threshold is 22 for every image in this folder.
